# 🌐 MuftSkill – Structured Learning Platform

MuftSkill is a free, no-login web platform that curates and organizes high-quality YouTube tutorials for students struggling to find structured learning content.  
It’s designed to cut through the noise, save time, and give learners a distraction-free, easy-to-navigate experience.

## ✨ Why I Built It

As a student from Bihar, I saw many learners around me wasting hours trying to find good tech tutorials — jumping from one video to another, getting lost in unrelated content.  
So I built **MuftSkill** to solve a real problem for real people — **a platform that simplifies learning and makes it accessible for everyone**.
